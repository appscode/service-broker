# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

First you need to have the software services by AppsCode installed in the cluster. Currently AppsCode Service Broker supports the following software service:

 - Kubedb

So we need to have Kubedb installed to go forward. To install Kubedb see [here](https://kubedb.com/docs/0.9.0-rc.1/setup/install/).

To check the installation you need the Service Catalog onto your cluster. So, this document assumes that you've installed Service Catalog onto your cluster. If you haven't, please see the [installation instructions](https://svc-cat.io/docs/install/). Optionally you may install the Service Catalog CLI (nammed `svcat`) from the `installing-the-service-catalog-cli` section.

> After satisfying the prerequisites, all commands in this document assume that you're operating out of the root of this repository.

## Install Service Broker

AppsCode Service Broker can be installed via a script or as a Helm chart.

- [Script](/docs/setup/install.md#Using-Script)
- [Helm](/docs/setup/install.md#Using-Helm)

### Using Script

To install AppsCode Service Broker in your Kubernetes cluster, run the following command:

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/service-broker/master/hack/deploy/install.sh | bash
...

configmap/kubedb created
deployment.apps/service-broker created
service/service-broker created
serviceaccount/service-broker created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/service-broker created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/service-broker created
clusterservicebroker.servicecatalog.k8s.io/service-broker created

waiting until service-broker deployment is ready

Successfully installed service-broker in kube-system namespace!
```

After successful installation, you should have a `service-broker-***` pod running in the `kube-system` namespace.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep service-broker
service-broker-***       1/1       Running   0          48s
```

#### Customizing Installer

The installer script and associated yaml files can be found in the [hack/deploy](https://github.com/appscode/service-broker/tree/master/hack/deploy) folder. You can see the full list of flags available to installer using `-h` flag.

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/service-broker/master/hack/deploy/install.sh | bash -s -- -h
install.sh - install service-broker

install.sh [options]

options:
--------
-h, --help                    show brief help
-n, --namespace=NAMESPACE     specify namespace (default: kube-system)
    --docker-registry         docker registry used to pull service-broker image (default: appscode)
    --image-pull-secret       name of secret used to pull service-broker image
    --port                    port number at which the broker will expose
    --catalogPath             the path of catalogs for different service plans
    --catalogNames            comma separated names of the catalogs for different service plans
    --storage-class           name of the storage-class for database storage
    --uninstall               uninstall service-broker
```

If you would like to run service broker pod in your own namespace say `my-ns` namespace, first create it and then pass the `--namespace=my-ns` flag:

```console
$ kubectl create namespace my-ns
namespace/my-ns created

$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/service-broker/master/hack/deploy/install.sh \
    | bash -s -- --namespace=my-ns
...
```

If you are using a private Docker registry, you need to pull the following docker images:

 - [appscode/service-broker](https://hub.docker.com/r/appscode/service-broker)

To pass the address of your private registry and optionally a image pull secret use flags `--docker-registry` and `--image-pull-secret` respectively.

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/service-broker/master/hack/deploy/install.sh \
    | bash -s -- --docker-registry=MY_REGISTRY [--image-pull-secret=SECRET_NAME]
...
```

### Using Helm

`Service Broker` can also be installed via [Helm](https://helm.sh/) using the [chart](https://github.com/appscode/service-broker/tree/master/chart/service-broker) from [AppsCode Charts Repository](https://github.com/appscode/charts). To install the chart with the release name `appscode-service-broker`:

```console
$ helm repo add appscode https://charts.appscode.com/stable/
$ helm repo update
$ helm search appscode/service-broker
$ helm install --name appscode-service-broker --namespace kube-system appscode/service-broker
```

To see the detailed configuration options, visit [here](https://github.com/appscode/service-broker/tree/master/chart/service-broker).

### Verify installation

To check whether service broker pod has started or not, run the following command:

```console
# for script installation
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app=appscode-service-broker --watch
NAMESPACE        NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system      appscode-service-broker-6f4f7b554d-hcvdd   0/1     Pending   0          0s
kube-system      appscode-service-broker-6f4f7b554d-hcvdd   0/1     Pending   0     0s
kube-system      appscode-service-broker-6f4f7b554d-hcvdd   0/1     ContainerCreating   0     0s
kube-system      appscode-service-broker-6f4f7b554d-hcvdd   1/1     Running   0     6s

# for helm installation
kube-system      appscode-service-broker-7d8cc8dcc-q7c6m   0/1   ContainerCreating   0     0s
kube-system      appscode-service-broker-7d8cc8dcc-q7c6m   1/1   Running   0     4s
```

Once the pods is running, you can cancel the above command by typing `Ctrl+C`.

Now, to confirm `ClusterServiceBroker`, `ClusterServiceClass`, `ClusterServicePlan` have been registered by the `Service Broker`, run the following command:

```console
$ kubectl get clusterservicebrokers -l app=service-broker
NAME             URL                                                      STATUS   AGE

$ kubectl get clusterserviceclass

mongodb-3-6                 default                 service-broker   mongodb         1m
mongodb-cluster-3-6         mongodb-cluster         service-broker   mongodb         1m
mysql-8-0                   default                 service-broker   mysql           1m

redis-4-0                   default                 service-broker   redis           1m
```

You can get the same thing in a different manner using Service Catalog CLI `svcat`.

```console
$ svcat get brokers
